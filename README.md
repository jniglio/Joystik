# Joystik
Joystik is a console that allows gamers to play their favorite retro games for a classic nostalgic feel at a fraction of the price. We aim to inspire players to also create their own games through an open source platform using Pygame. The console would act as a customizable new platform that doesnâ€™t need all the same bells and whistles as its predecessors.
